## Cloning

Since this repository utilizes git submodules, you must clone the repository recursively use the following command.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:KnightHacks/knighthacks_backend.git
```
The `-j8` flag parallelizes the cloning to save time in the cloning process.

Tip: If you are using ssh key passphrases and don't want to type in your passphrase an unbearable amount of times I suggest using [ssh-agent](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/add)
